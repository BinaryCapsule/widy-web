# Widy - What I did yesterday

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2548a709-302a-483d-9f5b-b1b7528ce23c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/widy-web/deploys)

This is the frontend code of the Widy web app (a React SPA).

It consumes the Widy API ([repo](https://github.com/BinaryCapsule/widy-api)).

> ðŸš¨ Note: This app is actually my personal **breakable toy** ðŸ§«ðŸ§ª
>
> Also, the api is hosted on a free Heroku dyno and therefore may go to sleep
> during periods of inactivity.
